# EQUUS PROTOCOL
Equus is a manual deflationary proof of stake (PoS) token which aims to build a trust-less staking ecosystem. Our protocol offers a liquidity mining powered staking platform to our users; whereby they can stake their EQUUS tokens, mining FEL tokens in the process. Deposits and withdrawals to the staking platform will incur a 5% burn to the total transactional value of EQUUS staked by said user.
